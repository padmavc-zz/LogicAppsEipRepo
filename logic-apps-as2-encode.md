# Get started with Encode AS2 Message

Connect to Applicability Statement 2 (AS2) - Encode AS2 Message to establish security and reliability when transmitting B2B messages over HTTP/S. It provides digital signing and encryption as well as acknowledgements via Message Disposition Notifications (MDN), which also leads to support for Non-Repudiation (NRR).

## Create the connection

### Prerequisites

* An Azure account; you can create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free)
* An integration account is required to use Encode AS2 message connector. See details on how to create an [integration account](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/app-service-logic-enterprise-integration-accounts/), add [partners](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/app-service-logic-enterprise-integration-partners/) and an [AS2 agreement](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/app-service-logic-enterprise-integration-as2/) to it.

### Connect to Encode AS2 Message using the following steps:

1. Create a Logic App.  [Create a Logic App](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/app-service-logic-create-a-logic-app/) provides an example

2. This connector does not have any triggers. Use other triggers to start the Logic App, such as a Request trigger.  In the Logic App designer, add a trigger and add an action.  Select Show Microsoft managed APIs in the drop down list and then enter “AS2” in the search box.  Select AS2 – Encode AS2 Message

3. If you haven’t previously created any connections to Integration account, you are prompted for the connection details

4. Enter the integration account details.  Properties with an asterisk are required

	| Property   | Details |
	| --------   | ------- |
	| Connection Name *    | Enter any name for your connection |
	| Integration Account * | Enter the integration account name; Be sure your integration account and Logic app are in the same Azure location |

  	Once complete, your connection details look similar to the following

5. Select Create  

6. Notice the connection has been created.  Provide AS2-From identifier, AS2-To identifier and Body details

## The AS2 Encode does the following

* Applies AS2/HTTP headers
* Signs outgoing messages, if enabled
* Encrypts outgoing messages, if enabled (for EDI/AS2, not MDN)
* Compresses the message, if enabled (for EDI/AS2, not MDN)
* Stores the payload in wire format if the NRR enabled for outbound decoded AS2 messages property is selected, and stores the message in wire format if the NRR enabled for outbound encoded AS2 messages property is selected
* Computes the MIC value and stores
* Updates and correlates records if user select NRR in AS2 agreement
* Routes the MDN generated by the AS2Decode to the end point
